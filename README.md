# FitnessGoal-Mobile-App
A mobile application that builds a fitness plan for users based on their body parameters and goal.
I developed this app for my thesis at University of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Computer Science Faculty.
This app has 4 main features described below:
1. Workout Plan - a plan that contains exercises for a period of time
2. Meal Plan - a plan that contains meals for a period of time
3. Hydration Tracker - a tracker to track the water consumption progress
4. Feed - a place where users can chat, ask for help, write feedback.
